# PROJECT-1
# Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview
This project implements a digit recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal is to classify hand-written digits (0-9) from the popular MNIST dataset. This project demonstrates the power of deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, in accurately recognizing digits from images.

## Features
- Uses the MNIST dataset for training and testing.
- Achieves a high accuracy in digit classification.
- Utilizes CNN architecture for feature extraction and classification.
- Implements data augmentation for improved performance.
  
## Dataset
The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of hand-written digits (28x28 grayscale images).

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Model Architecture
- Input: 28x28 grayscale images.
- Convolutional Layers followed by ReLU activation.
- Max Pooling layers for dimensionality reduction.
- Fully Connected Layers for classification.
- Softmax activation for output.
